            <p>An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.</p>
            <p>To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.</p>
            <p>In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.</p>
