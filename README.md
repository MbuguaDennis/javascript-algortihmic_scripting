# Basic Algorithmic Scripting
## Definition of Terms:
* An **algorithm** is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.
* To write an _effective algorithm_, it helps to **break a problem down into smaller parts** and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.
* In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.
